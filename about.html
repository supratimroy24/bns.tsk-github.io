<p>There is a believe that each one of us have come to this earth with a purpose and as I look back into the pages of my life the wordings of Shri Rabindranath Tagore</p>
<blockquote><p>“I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>reverberates and I feel a deep sense of satisfaction and immense happiness that the school which I had established at a time when private schools were a rare happening today has blossomed into a full fledged high school providing education to a large number of students. In all these years it has been my earnest desire to provide the best possible education, not just in terms of increasing knowledge but ensuring that the true goal of education is achieved i.e<strong>.&nbsp; Intelligence plus character-that is the goal of true education.</strong></p>

<p>In achieving this endeavour of mine has been the unstinted co-operation of the parents for I truly believe that Parents are the first and most important educators to their children and a school education can only be built on the foundation laid by the family.</p>
<p>Since those times the school has progressed by leaps and bounds and it gives me utmost pleasure to invite all those who have been a part of this journey and those who are yet to be a part of it to join me to know more about our school and all the activities it provides through this online portal.</p>

<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>To provide disciplined, value-based and academically strong education fostering holistic development.</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To maintain academic excellence aligned with SEBA standards while nurturing responsible citizens.</p>
