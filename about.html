<!-- FOUNDER MESSAGE -->

<div class="container">
<h2>Founder’s Message</h2>

<p>I believe that each one of us comes to this world with a purpose. As I reflect upon my journey, the words of Rabindranath Tagore deeply resonate within me:</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">“I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.”</blockquote>

<p>When this institution was founded in 1970, private schools were rare in our region. The vision was clear — to provide meaningful, disciplined, and value-based education rooted in character formation.</p>

<p>Over the decades, the school has grown into a full-fledged high school serving generations of students. Our constant endeavour has been to ensure that education here goes beyond textbooks — nurturing intelligence with character, because true education is defined by both knowledge and integrity.</p>

<p>This journey has been possible through the unwavering support of parents, who remain the first and most important educators of their children. Together, we continue to shape responsible and capable citizens.</p>

<p>I warmly invite you to explore our institution and become part of our continuing journey toward excellence.</p>

Founder Principal & President</p>
